# FireLion
FireLion visual library is multilingual component library, which main point is easyness of usage and high performance,
<br>Our idea is to provide high-responsible graphics library with its own component set;

Ideas:
- Easy-to-port Polygonal graphic data
- Easy-to-use object combination functions
- Strong Typization via extension

Second-plan ideas:
- Native drawing techniques
- High amount of supported platforms, including Web and Text formats [Console output]
- Scheduling and timing routines
- Fields values synchronization between devices [via web-server abilities]

Main target:
<br>
Introduce graphic technique with one (partially separated) drawer, which acts based on the component end-point algebraic formulas

Current supported languages:
* PHP (>= 5.6)

Minimal requirements:
  Copy any part of the project if you want to use it, and then specify a link to the official repo ( https://github.com/levzenin/FL ) or specify a link to an author ( https://github.com/levzenin ) or specify that your project uses a part of FireLion Framework, or just add an FireLion logo/emblem from the repository ( https://github.com/levzenin/FLL )
